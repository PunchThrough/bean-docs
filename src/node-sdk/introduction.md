## Welcome!

Welcome to the first official cross-platform Bean SDK and CLI documentation. Building cross-platform apps that interface with real hardware can be difficult and is why we have only supported fully native applications until now. With the help of the [noble library]() we were able to build the first official cross-platform Bean SDK and "loader" using Node.js.

The following platforms have been successfully tested:

* [Mac OS X](/node-sdk/install-osx/)
* [Linux (Desktop Debian distributions)](/node-sdk/install-linux/)
* [Windows 7, 8, 10](/node-sdk/install-windows/)
* [Raspberry Pi 1, 2 and 3](/node-sdk/install-rpi/)

#### Motivation

Small team, etc.

## CLI

The CLI will act as a "Bean Loader" application for Windows and Linux until we have a full-featured GUI loader built on top of the SDK.

## SDK/Library

Not officially "supported" or documented yet.
