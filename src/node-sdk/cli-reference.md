## Introduction

This is an exhaustive guide for each CLI command. If you are looking for a step-by-step "Getting Started" guide please refer here:

* [Getting started with the CLI Loader](/getting-started/cli-loader/)

The rest of this guide is coming soon! In the meantime, the CLI has helpful descriptions of commands and optional/positional arguments using `--help`.

Bean help:
