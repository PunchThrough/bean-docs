## Introduction

Grove is a system of easy-to-use components. They're solderless! Grove components come with their own male conectors pre-soldered. To connect them to the LightBlue Bean+, you use four-wire jumpers with corresponding female connectors.

Here's an example of a [Grove moisture sensor](http://wiki.iteadstudio.com/Moisture_Sensor) with a [Grove cable](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/How_To_Choose_The_Right_Cable) connected:

There are tons of Grove parts available for both input and output. They include [digital compasses](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_3-Axis_Digital_Compass), [solid state relays](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Solid_State_Relay), [magnetic switches](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Magnetic_Switch), and even [LED strip drivers](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_LED_Strip_Driver). We offer a [Grove Starter Kit](http://punchthrough.myshopify.com/collections/all/products/grove-starter-kit-pre-order) in our store with a few parts to get you started.

In this guide, you'll be using the [LED bar graph](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_LED_Bar) and [potentiometer](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Rotary_Angle_Sensor) included in the Starter Kit.
