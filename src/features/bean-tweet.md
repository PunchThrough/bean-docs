## Introduction
Lets say we want to tweet the Bean's temperature. We would have to go through the process of building a server and transferring the Bean's information to it, either through an iOS application or a rasberry pi. Node-RED is used to connect the Bean to the internet that mitigates the need of building a server. In this tutorial, I will guide you in how to tweet the Bean's temperature through Node-RED. 

## Setup

Please make sure you're familiar with the following before starting this guide:

### Software
* Bean Loader ([install guides](#))
* Node-RED installation ([install Node-RED](#))

### Hardware

* LightBlue Bean
* Computer device

## Program the Bean
This tutorial assumes you have completed the [Getting Started guide](#). It covers tasks such as connecting to and programming the Bean with the Bean Loader.

Connect to your Bean and upload this Arduino sketch:
```
//trial
```
