## Introduction
In order for the Bean (or any device for that matter) to communicate to the computer, they must share a common communication protocol.  There are a lot of communication protocols. Most protocols can generally be split into two categories:  parallel or serial.  We will focus on Serial Communications. 

Serial communication can be really helpful for debugging, sending information from the Bean to the computer or app, and sending information from the computer or app to the Bean. 

 In this guide, we will go over how Serial Communication works, how to use the Serial Monitor on the Arduino IDE to see serial data received by the Bean, how to send serial data from the Arduino to the Bean.
