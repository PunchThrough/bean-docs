## First-Time Users

Are you installing Bean Loader for the first time? Check out our Getting Started guides to get up and running fast:

* [Getting Started on OS X](../../getting-started/os-x/)

## Software Downloads

Bean Loader for Windows and OS X relies on the Arduino IDE to compile your Arduino sketches and program the Bean.

On iOS and Android, Bean Loader uses the Bean Cloud Compiler to compile your Arduino sketches.

### Windows

* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* [CLI Loader for Windows](../../node-sdk/install-windows/)

**Warning:** The Windows Loader available on the Windows store is discontinued, we are moving all support to a cross-platform solution, starting with the [CLI Loader](../../getting-started/cli-loader/).
