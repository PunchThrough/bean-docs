## How can we help you?

Our developers provide all support via email. If you have a question for us, you can send us an email at [support@punchthrough.com](mailto:support@punchthrough.com). We are a small team of engineers and will work our best to help - we try to respond to all emails within 2 business days.

You can also try [asking for help on Beantalk](http://beantalk.punchthrough.com)! Beantalk is our community forum where people talk about Bean and ask questions when they need help. While we frequent the forums, we are not able to provide technical support.
