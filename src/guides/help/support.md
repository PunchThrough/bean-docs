## How can we help you?

Our developers provide all support via email. If you have a question for us, you can send us an email at [info@punchthrough.com](mailto:info@punchthrough.com). We are a small team of engineers and will work our best to help - we try to respond to all issues within 48 hours.

You can also try [asking for help on Beantalk](http://beantalk.punchthrough.com)! Beantalk is our community forum where people talk about Bean and ask questions when they need help.
