## How can we help you?

If you are having an issue with your Bean, you can try [asking for help on Beantalk](http://beantalk.punchthrough.com)! Beantalk is our community forum where people talk about Bean and ask questions when they need help.

If your answer is not answered on Beantalk, you can send us an email at [info@punchthrough.com](mailto:info@punchthrough.com). We provide all of our one-on-one support via email. Our developers do not provide support via Beantalk.

In your email, be sure to include what loader and device you are using. In addition to this, please answer the following questions:

1. If you are not able to connect and load a sketch now, were you able to out of the box?
2. Does your problem persist if you use a different Bean Loader?  How about on a different computer or phone?
3. Does your problem persist if using a different Bean? How about if you replace or recharge the battery?
