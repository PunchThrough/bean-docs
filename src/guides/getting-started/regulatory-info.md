## Instructions for Safe Use

To avoid malfunction or damage to your [LightBlue Bean or Bean+](../tech-specs/#lightblue-bean-and-bean-) please observe the following:

### Bean ###

* Do not use any battery to power the Bean other than a CR2032 coin cell.
* Do not expose the Bean to excessive heat. The Bean is intended for operation at 0 ̊C to 45 ̊C.
* Do not expose the Bean to water, moisture, or place on a conductive surface while the Bean is powered on.
* Do not power externally connected peripherals from the Bean coin cell unless the current drawn is much less than 1mA.
* Handle the Bean gently to avoid mechanical or electrical damage to the circuit board and connectors.
* Handle the Bean while powered only when necessary. Handle the edges to avoid electrostatic discharge.
* The Bean is intended for operation at distances greater than 20cm from a human body.
* Keep out of reach from children; small parts and batteries can be hazardous and may cause death if ingested.
* Always dispose of used batteries according to local rules and instructions.

### Bean+ ###

* Do not connect anything other than a 5V micro-USB charger to the micro-USB connector on the Bean+.
* Do not expose the Bean+ to excessive heat. The Bean+ is intended for operation at 0 ̊C to 45 ̊C.
* Do not expose the Bean+ to water, moisture, or place on a conductive surface while the Bean+ switched on.
* Do not exceed 200mA total current drawn from the Bean+ by all connected peripherals.
* Handle the Bean+ gently to avoid mechanical or electrical damage to the circuit board and connectors.
* Handle the Bean+ while powered only when necessary. Handle the edges to avoid electrostatic discharge.
* The Bean+ is intended for operation at distances greater than 20cm from a human body.
* Keep out of reach from children; small parts and batteries can be hazardous and may cause death if ingested.
* Always dispose of used batteries according to local rules and instructions.

### FCC (Federal Communications Commission)

This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause harmful interference, and (2) this device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.

This equipment complies with FCC radiation exposure limits set forth for an uncontrolled environment. End users must follow the specific operating instructions for satisfying RF exposure compliance. This transmitter must be at least 20 cm from the user and must not be co-located or operating in conjunction with any other antenna or transmitter.

This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits for a Class B digital device, pursuant to part 15 of the FCC Rules. These limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference will not occur in a particular installation. If this equipment does cause harmful interference to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the interference by one or more of the following measures:

* Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.
* Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.
* Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that which the receiver is connected.
* Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/TV technician for help.

Changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party responsible for compliance could void the user’s authority to operate the equipment.
The information in this guide may change without notice. The manufacturer assumes no responsibility for any errors that may appear in this guide.

### ISED (Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada)
