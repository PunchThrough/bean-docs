## Sponsorship

Punch Through Design can help sponsor your hackathon or meetup. Typically we provide hardware but we are also open for other forms of sponsorship. We have previously sponsored events like [IoT Hack Day](http://iothackday.mn/), [IoT Fuse](http://iotfuse.com/) and [Arduino group of Minnesota](http://arduino.mn/) and especially encourage events for underrepresented groups such as women and people of color. [Contact us about sponsoring an event](mailto:info@punchthrough.com?subject=Sponsorship%20Opportunity).

## Speakers

We have in-house experts in Bluetooth Low Energy, iBeacons, hardware development, software development, prototyping, Arduino and much more. [Contact us about speaking at an event](mailto:info@punchthrough.com?subject=Come%20and%20speak!).

## Workshops

We offer workshops on the LightBlue Bean, Bluetooth Low Energy and iBeacons. Whether you are learning basic hardware hacking, or want to learn about the different BLE protocols as an advanced user, we can help you out on the way. [Contact us about arranging a workshop](mailto:info@punchthrough.com?subject=Workshop%20Request).
