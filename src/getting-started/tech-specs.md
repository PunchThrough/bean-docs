## Bean and Bean+ Features

Bean and Bean+ are two different flavors of the same software, the [LightBlue Platform](http://punchthrough.com/platform). Here's what they have in common:

__Program Wirelessly:__ No more digging your board out of your project enclosure: Bean is programmed wirelessly over Bluetooth Low Energy!

__Cross-Platform:__ Compile and upload sketches with Bean Loader for Windows, OS X, iOS, and Android. Bean also has SDKs for iOS, OS X, and Android for native app development.

__Arduino-Compatible:__ Bean Loader integrates with the Arduino IDE for Windows and OS X. Your favorite Arduino libraries work on Bean too.

__Built-In Peripherals:__ Both Bean and Bean+ come with an accelerometer, a temperature sensor, and an RGB LED. Start building right awayâ€”no soldering necessary.

__Built-In Protoboard:__ Making something with just a couple components? Solder and wire them right on the Bean's prototyping area.

__Small Size:__ The perfect size for tiny projects, Bean is really small! Need more space? It's totally OK to cut off the protoboard.

__Coin Cell Battery:__ Bean ships with a coin cell battery included. You can start hacking before you even take it out of the box.

__Rechargeable LiPo:__ It's easy to keep Bean+ going. The included lithium polymer battery charges via Micro USB, so power is never out of reach.

__Grove Connectors:__ Just connecting a couple of components? Bean+ supports the solderless Grove connector for easy and quick component connection.

__Addon Board Support:__ We make addon boards to add more functionality to your Bean+. If you want to connect your own parts, you can assemble and plug in your custom addon board.

__Dual-Voltage Operation:__ Bean+ operates at a user-selectable 3.3V or 5V. No more adding logic level converters just to talk to your fancy graphic LCD.
