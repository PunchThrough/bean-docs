Congratulations! You're the proud new owner of a LightBlue Bean or Bean+. What’s even cooler is you are now part of our creative and innovative community that’s building some pretty awesome wearable and IoT devices. We’ll go over the Bean and Bean+ features, and the resources we provide so you can begin building. We at Punch Through love building wireless products with the Bean and Bean+, and we think you will too!

## Get Started

Ready to get started with Bean? Start by [installing Bean Loader](../install-loader) for your favorite platform.

Or keep reading to learn more!

## Bean and Bean+ Features

Bean and Bean+ are two different flavors of the same software, the [LightBlue Platform](http://punchthrough.com/platform). Here's what they have in common:

## Be an Inventor

Programming the Bean has never been so easy. With wireless programming and our Bean Loader app, you can write code anywhere and everywhere. There are unlimited possibilities of what you can build with the Bean!  Here are some ideas to get you started:

__Make Bean run (almost) forever:__
Since Bean runs on battery power, we've made it power-efficient. You can tell your Bean to wake up when a phone connects, when a specific pin toggles or when you tap it with your finger. 

__Talk to your connected devices:__
Bean uses Bluetooth Low Energy, so wireless communications won't suck the battery dry. Control motors or servos from your phone, or log data from your air quality sensor straight to your laptop without wires.

## The Beantalk Community
We're proud to host one of the coolest groups of makers at [Beantalk](http://beantalk.punchthrough.com/), our community forums. If you're looking for project inspiration, troubleshooting issues, or showing off something cool you built, Beantalk is the place to go!
