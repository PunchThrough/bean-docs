Congratulations! You're the proud new owner of a LightBlue Bean or Bean+. We think you've made a great choice.

We at Punch Through have been building wireless products for over five years. We've taken our consulting experience at Punch Through and built a platform that we love to use.

With Bean, it's easy to prototype your next connected device. Bean is our favorite way to build cool stuff with Bluetooth Low Energy, and we think you'll like it too.

## What's inside the Bean?

Bean and Bean+ are two different flavors of the same software, the [LightBlue Platform](#). Here's what they have in common:

{{{img_rel this 'bean-and-plus-sketch.png' 'Bean and Bean+ feature comparison'}}}

* **Program Wirelessly:** No more digging your board out of your project enclosure: Bean is programmed wirelessly over Bluetooth Low Energy!
* **Cross-Platform:** Compile and upload sketches with Bean Loader for Windows, OS X, iOS, and Android. Bean also has SDKs for iOS, OS X, and Android for native app development.
* **Arduino-Compatible:** Bean Loader integrates with the Arduino IDE for Windows and OS X. Your favorite Arduino libraries work on Bean too.
* **Built-In Peripherals:** Both Bean and Bean+ come with an accelerometer, a temperature sensor, and an RGB LED. Start building right awayâ€”no soldering necessary.

### Bean Specifics

* **Built-In Protoboard:** Making something with just a couple components? Solder and wire them right on the Bean's prototyping area.
* **Small Size:** The perfect size for tiny projects, Bean is *really small!* Need more space? It's totally OK to cut off the protoboard.
* **Coin Cell Battery:** Bean ships with a coin cell battery included. You can start hacking before you even take it out of the box.

### Bean+ Specifics

* **Rechargeable LiPo:** It's easy to keep Bean+ going. The included lithium polymer battery charges via Micro USB, so power is never out of reach.
* **Grove Connectors:** Just connecting a couple of components? Bean+ supports the solderless Grove connector for easy and quick component connection.
* **Addon Board Support:** We make [addon boards](#) to add more functionality to your Bean+. If you want to connect your own parts, you can assemble and plug in your custom addon board.
* **Dual-Voltage Operation:** Bean+ operates at a user-selectable 3.3V or 5V. No more adding logic level converters just to talk to your fancy graphic LCD.

## What do I do with Bean?

### Build Bean into a project!

Bean is easy to program. Write code anywhere and send it to Bean wirelessly. Since it's wireless, you can leave it inside your project box and reconfigure it anywhere.

### Make Bean run (almost) forever!

Since Bean runs on battery power, we've made it power-efficient. You can tell your Bean to wake up [when a phone connects](#), [when a specific pin toggles](#) or [when you tap it with your finger](#).

### Talk to your connected devices!

Bean uses [Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)](#), so talking to your phone or laptop won't suck the battery dry. Control motors or servos from your phone, or log data from your air quality sensor straight to your Macbook without wires.
