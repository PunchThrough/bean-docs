Congratulations! You're the proud new owner of a LightBlue Bean or Bean+.  What’s even cooler is you are now part of our creative and innovative community that’s building some pretty awesome wearable and IoT devices.  We’ll go over the Bean and Bean+ features, and the resources we provide so you can begin building. [We at Punch Through love building wireless products with the Bean and Bean+] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh3vIK8zMBE), and we think you will too! 

## Bean and Bean+ Features:
Bean and Bean+ are two different flavors of the same software, the [LightBlue Platform] (#). Here's what they have in common:

__Program Wirelessly:__ No more digging your board out of your project enclosure: Bean is programmed wirelessly over Bluetooth Low Energy!<br>
__Cross-Platform:__ Compile and upload sketches with Bean Loader for Windows, OS X, iOS, and Android. Bean also has SDKs for iOS, OS X, and Android for native app development. <br>
__Arduino-Compatible:__ Bean Loader integrates with the Arduino IDE for Windows and OS X. Your favorite Arduino libraries work on Bean too.
__Built-In Peripherals:__ Both Bean and Bean+ come with an accelerometer, a temperature sensor, and an RGB LED. Start building right away—no soldering necessary.

## Bean Specs:

__Built-In Protoboard:__ Making something with just a couple components? Solder and wire them right on the Bean's prototyping area.
__Small Size:__ The perfect size for tiny projects, Bean is really small! Need more space? It's totally OK to cut off the protoboard.
__Coin Cell Battery:__ Bean ships with a coin cell battery included. You can start hacking before you even take it out of the box.

## Bean+ Specs:

__Rechargeable LiPo:__ It's easy to keep Bean+ going. The included lithium polymer battery charges via Micro USB, so power is never out of reach.
__Grove Connectors:__ Just connecting a couple of components? Bean+ supports the solderless Grove connector for easy and quick component connection.
__Addon Board Support:__ We make addon boards to add more functionality to your Bean+. If you want to connect your own parts, you can assemble and plug in your custom addon board.
__Dual-Voltage Operation:__ Bean+ operates at a user-selectable 3.3V or 5V. No more adding logic level converters just to talk to your fancy graphic LCD.

## Be an Inventor:
Programming the Bean has never been so easy.  With wireless programming and our Bean Loader app, you can write code anywhere and everywhere. There are unlimited possibilities of what you can build with the Bean!  Here are some ideas to get you started:

__Make Bean run (almost) forever!__
  Since Bean runs on battery power, we've made it power-efficient. You can tell
  your Bean to wake up when a phone connects, when a specific pin toggles or
  when you tap it with your finger.

__Talk to your connected devices!__
  Bean uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), so talking to your phone or laptop won't
  suck the battery dry. Control motors or servos from your phone, or log data from
  your air quality sensor straight to your Macbook without wires.

## The Beantalk Community
We're proud to host one of the coolest groups of makers at Beantalk, our community forums. If you're looking for project inspiration, troubleshooting issues, or showing off something cool you built, Beantalk is the place to go!
